### Order Insight Digital
When cardholders are reviewing their card statement, confusion over if a purchase is legitimate is one of the most common occurrances. A cardholders first reaction when this occurs is typically to pick up the phone to contact the issuing bank, tying up valuable issuer resources in an attempt to identify this purchase and/or pursue a dispute. With digital goods purchases on the rise and currently representing almost 20% of all disputes Visa sees, the potential to see an increase in dispute volume is likely. This can be expensive, as the cost of fielding the telephone calls and working a dispute can be far greater than the purchase amount itself.
