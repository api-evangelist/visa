    description: >-
      When cardholders are reviewing their card statement, confusion over if a
      purchase is legitimate is one of the most common occurrances. A
      cardholders first reaction when this occurs is typically to pick up the
      phone to contact the issuing bank, tying up valuable issuer resources in
      an attempt to identify this purchase and/or pursue a dispute. With digital
      goods purchases on the rise and currently representing almost 20% of all
      disputes Visa sees, the potential to see an increase in dispute volume is
      likely. This can be expensive, as the cost of fielding the telephone calls
      and working a dispute can be far greater than the purchase amount itself.
