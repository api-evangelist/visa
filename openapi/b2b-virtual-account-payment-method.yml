    for existing card accounts and to request virtual accounts while setting controls.
    The endpoints allow the user to retrieve the status of new account requests, view
    authorization rules, submit virtual card requisitions for an employee , and retrieve
    security code (CVV2) details of an existing account.
- name: Buyer Management Service
  description: The Buyer Service provides self-service capabilities that simplify
    and reduce the implementation process for new VPA buyers (and other downstream
    systems). Buyers can be created from scratch or from a pre-defined Buyer Template.
    Either way, these APIs help streamline the process and increase the speed of buyer
    deployments, as well as provide third parties with insight into the buyers configurations
    for troubleshooting. For more details about the requirements for creating a buyer,
    please reference the <a href="/pages/B2B-virtual-account-payment-method-codes#buyer_setup_details">Buyer
    Setup Details</a> page.

  description: The Proxy web service is used for managing a pool of Single-Use Accounts
    (SUAs) linked to a proxy. With this web service, you can create proxy pool(s)
    for a buyer, update details of the proxy, delete unused pools and get details
    about an existing pool(e.g. number of available accounts).

                                      range type, etc.-  have the same sequence number.
                                      E.g. amount, currency code and range type will
                                      all have 0. If there is a rule that can have
                                      multiple amounts e.g. Exact match, then each
                                      VPAS rule overrides must have a unique sequence
                                      number so first VPAS has 0, then second has
                                      1, third has 2.

                                    override. Each rule starts with 0 so if you have
                                    an SPV and BUS, then SPV will have sequence 0
                                    and BUS will have a 0. If there are multiple fields/
                                    overrides within a rule, e.g. SPV.  Each override
                                    - amount, currency code, range type, etc.-  have
                                    the same sequence number. E.g. amount, currency
                                    code and range type will all have 0.  If there
                                    is a rule that can have multiple amounts e.g.
                                    Exact match, then each VPAS rule overrides must
                                    have a unique sequence number so first VPAS has
                                    0, then second has 1, third has 2.
